# Skrifo
Mediawiki extension for the Skriptenforum project

This repository contains [Skriptenforum](https://www.skriptenforum.net)'s customizations 
of Mediawiki, packed into an extension. You can use it as an inspiration or template for 
your own customizations. The extension requires the [Tweeki skin](http://tweeki.thai-land.at) 
that has also been developed for Skriptenforum.
